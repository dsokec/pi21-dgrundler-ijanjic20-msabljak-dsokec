# Formatting Text with Markdown

With Markdown you can concentrate on the content of your project.

For example you create a heading like that:

	# Heading Level 1

If you want to create a level 2 heading:

	## Heading Level 2
	
**This is bold text** and the following one becomes *italic*.

Images can be added via the clipboard or the file management:

If you hover with the mouse cursor over the image link, a preview is shown.

An overview about the complete Markdown syntax can be found **in the help**.

## Insert HTML code

You can always use <b>HTML code</b> is needed. Markdown and HTML can be mixed together.
